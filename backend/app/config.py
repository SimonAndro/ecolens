3. Identify Opportunities for Improvement: Detect areas in the image that could benefit from greener practices or technologies, and provide specific recommendations to address these issues.
4. Educate on Best Practices: Use the context of the image to educate users about best practices in sustainability and how they can implement these practices in their own lives or projects.
5. Encourage Sustainable Actions: Motivate users to take actionable steps toward a greener lifestyle or more sustainable operations based on the insights gained from the image.
